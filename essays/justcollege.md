If you're like me, you've probably come across the r/ApplyingToCollege subreddit. A typical post I stumble across goes along these lines:

> I took 23 APs, scored 1600 on SAT and 36 on ACT, and *literally worked at NASA/cured cancer/ran a 100 million dollar startup*. I still got rejected from *prestigious college*. What's even the point of it all? I wasted the entirety of high school and have nothing to show for it. When my friends went to homecoming, I was studying. It hurts seeing people around me getting in...

A typical reaction is deep anxiety, then rationalization ("his essays probably sucked/she lives in the Bay Area/they're looking for well-rounded people..."). Other people will resolve to grind even harder or give up. 

But I'm nagged by something. "Have nothing to show for it"? You literally listed all of your accomplishments! Isn't curing cancer a worthwhile thing to do, regardless of whether it gets you into Harvard? I've seen many people who are disturbingly close to saying no, it isn't worth anything if you don't get in. Did you take all those AP classes because you were curious? The majority of people tell me it's all about the GPA boost. Did you meet new people who shared your interests through those clubs you started? Nope, colleges are looking for "leadership".


Take high school research. Students will proudly talk about using AI to improve public health or developing ceramic supercapacitors. And I think that this work is good and important (even if 95% of the work was done by the student's mentor). Yet if you ask them what inspired them to do this research, they'll have a canned response about the importance of science, wanting to contribute to society, etc. It's blatantly obvious that no one does this except for college admissions.
