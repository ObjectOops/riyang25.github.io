# About
My name is Richard Yang. I'm currently a junior in high school. 

Here's some of my current interests.
- Physics. For the past year or so, I've studied for the [USA Physics Olympiad](https://aapt.org/physicsteam). In 2024, I qualified for the US Physics Team. I like solid state physics.
- Math. My main focus used to be the [AMC Competition Series](https://maa.org), but nowadays I'm spending more time on higher math. I'm interested in learning differential geometry and topology, and I'm working through their prerequisites. 
- Computer Science. After taking AP Computer Science A in ninth grade, my focus on coding was sporadic, but I've taken [a lot](/coursework.md) of university level computer science courses. 

I'm the current organizer of the [Iowa City Math Circle](https://iowacitymathcircle.org). 

Here's my [CV](./resume/index.md).

## Trivia
Some useless facts about me that don't belong anywhere else. 
- I can type consistently around 110 WPM (via [typingtest.com](https://www.typingtest.com)), but have typed above 160 WPM on tests like [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) (where there are only common English words randomly ordered.) Of course, my actual writing speed is much slower, on the order of ten words per minute.
- The two games that I'm decent at:
  - Tetris
  - Geometry Dash
