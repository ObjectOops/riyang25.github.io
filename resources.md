# Resources
Here are some things I've written.

## Class Notes
- [Operating Systems](/notes/operatingsystems.md)
  - I'm taking this class right now, and I'll be updating these notes every week. So don't expect them to be useful in their current state.

## Math & Physics
I've cowritten a number of [handouts](https://iowacitymathcircle.org/archives) dealing with topics on the AMC competitions.
